# What is this?
dwelling is a helper app I designed to cope with my terrible managment skills. It is inspired by messangers like Telegram and displays content (notes/reminders etc) as separate chats.
It allows you to have your texts/images/audios in blocks that you can easily write/change/delete, just like you would do with messages in any app. 

**So this app is basically DMs, but only with yourself.**
## Managment?
Imagine you have something important planned for next Tuesday. 
You send a message to your friend who doesn't have ADHD and beg them to remind you. 
Have no neurotypical friends? What a shame, me too.

Now dwelling can be your little friend who you DM, mark it as a reminder, and move on with your life. 
When dwelling gives you a reminder notification (or alarm), simply click on it and the app will send you into the note, so you have the full context of your plans you built a week ago but promptly forgot. Well, good thing you got this app.

Managment related functions:

* Set reminders for individual messages or full threads
* Set alarms for important things
* Have a cool little widget on your screen for shopping lists and what not
* Built-in to do lists you can mark as done
* Finance tracker

# Why not just use a simple Notes app?

* Blocks. BLOCKS. I love storing things in DMs
* Embedded links
* Images
* Voice memos
* Ease of categorization

Cool neat things

* You can SEARCH in this app

If you are anything like me you store things in the most unexpected places
Well, no more. Go into your memos and search for a keyword. Don't remember when to pick up ADHD meds? Search "meds" or something in the search. cool, ey?

* You can IMPORT 

Got an old bad notes app on your phone that doesn't have cool features like dwelling does? Migrate. You'll be able to search through that mess and navigate it easier.

Got an old twitter account you don't wish to associate with anymore, but you still want to keep information on it for your eyes only? Have at it. Your tweets will be stored as a separate DM thread.

Same for VK, same for your Telegram channels. I had cringe accounts, we've all been there.

* get this ***YOU CAN SYNC IT WITH YOUR OTHER DEVICES***

Got a PC? Want to have your ideas in front of you or saved? Access your threads as they are synced whenever you have internet.
Use the desktop app to have a togable layer that contains your needed threads, or even just individual messages! How cool is that?

Are you big into art? Have your references saved. How? <br>
Found a cool image on twitter? Copy the link, have the image in your thread, push it into your desktop layer. <br> 
Have an image saved? Upload it > push to layer <br>
Have a link to it? Pastle link > push to layer <br>
Too much pushing? Select a whole thread at once, click push > only images > done.

Now you have a togable layer of references that can stay on top while you work/draw.
Arrange them however you like.
The power is in your hands.

* Your home page is your diary

It's like twitter, but for your eyes only. <br>
You can post cringe or even vent. No one will see

# Have I sold it to you?
